### More about me
My name is Sara Sisti and I’m a software & AI developer, artist, and researcher based in Milan.
I hold a bachelor’s and master’s degree in Statistics and Data Science from the University of Milan-Bicocca. Over the past years I’ve worked across data science, software engineering, and AI research. I'm having a lot of fun exploring comfyUI and open source models for creative AI. 

Outside of work, I explore the intersections of art and technology through painting, generative AI, and multimedia art. I’m also an avid reader and I’m endlessly curious about new fields, currently diving into neuroscience and non-ordinary states of consciousness.
